        SCENE Gardens in Castle Adamant. A river runs across the<br>
        back of the stage, crossed by a rustic bridge. Castle<br>
        Adamant in the distance.<br>
        Girl Graduates discovered seated at the feet of Lady<br>
        Psyche<br>
        CHORUS OF GIRLS & SOLOS (Lady Psyche, Melissa and Sacharissa)<br>

       <h4 class="chorus"> Chorus: Towards the empyrean heights<br></h4>
        
       <p class="speech">Every kind of lore,<br>
        We've taken several easy flights,<br>
        And mean to take some more.<br>
        In trying to achieve success<br>
        No envy racks our heart,<br>
        And all the knowledge we possess,<br>
        We mutually impart.</p><br>
    
        <h4 class="mel">Mel</h4>
        Pray, what authors should she read<br>
        Who in Classics would succeed?<br>
    
        <h4 class="Psy">Psyche</h4>
       If you'd climb the Helicon,<br>
        You should read Anacreon,<br>
        Ovid's Metamorphoses,<br>
        Likewise Aristophanes,<br>
        And the works of Juvenal:<br>
        These are worth attention, all;<br>
        But, if you will be advised,<br>
        You will get them Bowdlerized!<br>
    
        
        <h4 class="chorus">Chorus: Ah! we will get them Bowdlerized!</h4>
    
        <h4 class="sac">Sacharissa</h4>
        Pray you, tell us, if you can,<br>
        What's the thing that's known as Man?<br>
    
        <h4 class="Psy">Psyche</h4>
        Man will swear and man will storm—<br>
        Man is not at all good form—<br>
        Is of no kind of use—<br>
        Man's a donkey — Man's a goose—<br>
        Man is coarse and Man is plain—<br>
        Man is more or less insane—<br>
        Man's a ribald — Man's a rake,<br>
        Man is Nature's sole mistake!<br>
    
        <h4 class="chorus">Chorus: We'll a memorandum make Man is Nature's sole mistake!</h4>
    
        <p class="speech">And thus to empyrean height<br>
        Of ev'ry kind of lore,<br>
        In search of wisdom's pure delight,<br>
        Ambitiously we soar.<br>
        In trying to achieve success<br>
        No envy racks our heart,<br>
        For all we know and all we guess<br>
        We mutually impart!<br>
        And all the knowledge we possess,<br>
        We mutually impart,<br>
        We mutually impart, impart.</p><br>
